# CSS Battle Solutions

Welcome to my **CSS Battle Solutions** repository! This project showcases my solutions to various CSS challenges from [CSS Battle](https://cssbattle.dev/), a platform that tests your CSS skills through fun and engaging battles.

## ðŸš€ Approach

In each challenge, my goal was to replicate the target designs using pure CSS while keeping the code clean and efficient. I focused on utilizing modern CSS techniques, including Flexbox and Grid layouts, along with animations and transitions to enhance the visual appeal.
